To whom it may concern,

On 2020-11-16, Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) of the HKSAR launched "LeaveHomeSafe" application, a digital tool for citizens to record their visit history to help trace COVID-19 infection contacts. It is available for download in Google Play and Apple AppStore.  Nonetheless, the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) of the Hong Kong Police Force has received several reports of fake "LeaveHomeSafe" webpages, purporting to be the official "LeaveHomeSafe" official application, on GitHub.

The webpages violated the criminal offence of "Forgery", contrary to Section 71 of the Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 200, Laws of Hong Kong.

Request for removal of these webpages in question is hereby submitted. Please also remove all the "Fork" version of the fake application webpages. Enclosed please find the links for your action:-
